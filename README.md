A python data project analyzing scotch whiskys

In this fun project I downloaded a dataset with rankings and prices of several scotch whisky brands. In my analysis, I utilized data cleaning, data manipulation, and data visualization in order to answer the following questions:

1. How do the 3 scotch categories perform according to review scores?
2. Which category is produced and sold in the greatest quantity?
3. Which scotches provide the best overall value?
4. My friend was upset that a particular bottle wasn't in the best values list, so why not?
